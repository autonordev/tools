## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've identified a security vulnerability, please contact the maintainer via email (eleanor at autonor &gt;dot&lt; me) or [open a security report on GitHub](https://github.com/autonordev/tools/security/advisories/new). Please do not attempt to contact the maintainer via other methods, or contact anyone other than the maintainer.

> **Warning**: **Do not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities in any way.**

You should get a response back as soon as possible confirming we've received your report. If you've not got a reply within 2 days, please open an issue (do not describe the nature of the security issue; just that you reported one) or [security report](https://github.com/autonordev/tools/security/advisories/new).

We'll investigate your report as soon as possible and keep you updated as much as we can.

Once we've been able to appropriately handle the vulnerability, we'll let you know when you're clear to disclose what you've found. Due to the nature of our tools, users may be out-of-date for a very long time, so we may ask you to wait up to 90-180 days before publicly disclosing, just to ensure that our users are not at risk of impact.

Thank you for your support in helping us ensure our tools remain safe.
