# Installing Gaffer

## via Aftman or Foreman

[TODO: Aftman-compatible releases](https://github.com/eleanorlm/gaffer/issues/1)

## via npm

Gaffer is published on [the npm registry](https://npmjs.com/) as `gaffer-rbx`.

You may install it globally via your preferred JS package manager of choice.

## via Path

You may download the binary for your OS from the latest release and place it in your path.

If you don't know what that means, then you should probably use a different installation method.

## from Source

Upon downloading the source (and running the `yarn` command, on version ^3.3.0), you can then run `npm link` from the
`cli` directory, or build the binary yourself by running `yarn build` (from the repo root).
