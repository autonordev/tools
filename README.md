# tools

This repository houses the tools I have created and maintain for use in developing Roblox games.

These tools are:

- [Gaffer](https://github.com/autonordev/tools/tree/main/gaffer), a monorepo orchestrator (experimental)
- Axon, a package linker for use with Gaffer (not yet open sourced)

and any further tools I develop in this domain.

Documentation and more can be found at [tools.autonor.me](https://tools.autonor.me).
